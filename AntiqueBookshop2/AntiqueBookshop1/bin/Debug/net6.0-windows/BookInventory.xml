Lofting created the character of Dr. Dolittle while in the trenches fighting for the British in World War I - between 1914 and 1918. Not wanting to write to his children about the war he illustrated fanciful letters to them involving the Doctor and his adventures. After being injured in the war and moving to Connecticut in the United States, Lofting developed the character into stories and began publishing them, eventually publishing ten books during his life and two more posthumously. The sequel to The Story of Doctor Dolittle, The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle (1922) won the second ever awarded Newbery Medal in 1933. The Story of Doctor Dolittle fell out of favor around the 1970s because of overtly racist material in the books. Recent reprints of the stories have added to the controversy because any mention of race or color is taken out, including a story in the original book about a African Prince wishing to be turned white in order to marry 'Sleeping Beauty.'</Summary></Book><Book><Id>4</Id><title>The Story of Mankind</title><timePeriod>1921</timePeriod><author>Hendrik Willem Van Loon</author><edition>Signed First Edition</edition><Summary>The Story of Mankind by Hendrik Willem van Loon was published in 1921 and was the first book awarded the Newbery Award, which goes to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.

The 1942 was made shorter, and the author limited herself to 600 vocabulary words in order to make the text easier for children to read and enjoy on their own. In 1950 there was a slight revision of the 42 version, so the 1950 is considered a second printing of the 1942 first edition. The 1924 version has 4 color-plate illustrations by Dorothy Lake Gregory, where the later versions are black and white. The original printing was also housed in a white illustrated box.</Summary></Book><Book><Id>8</Id><title>Tales from Silver Lands</title><timePeriod>1924</timePeriod><author>Charles J Finger</author><edition>First Edition</edition><Summary>Tales from Silver Lands is a collection of 19 folk and fairy tales from Central and South America that won the Newberry Award for outstanding children's literature in 1925.

Each story within the book is read or observed by the main character of the next story, and as the first five stories are interrupted at a pivotal moment, the last part of the novel ties everything together and closes each story in reverse chronological order. The melding of wildly different stories is often praised by critics, who claim it makes the work fantastic and complex, and the challenge of the text puts into the 'puzzle book' genre. Cloud Atlas won the British Book Awards Literary Fiction Award and the Richard &amp; Judy Book of the Year award, and was short-listed for the 2004 Booker Prize, Nebula Award, Arthur C. Clarke Award, and other awards, placing it among the most-honored works of fiction in recent history.

Inspired by Hemingway's time as a war correspondent for The North American Newspaper Alliance during the Spanish Civil War, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a stark and brutal commentary on the nature of war, sacrifice, and death. In fact, many believe his work is among the best depictions of the Spanish Civil War written. As with some of Hemingway's other work, many of the characters, experiences, and events were based off real people and battles Hemingway saw.One of the most interesting qualities of For Whom the Bell Tolls is the use and restraint of profanity. Even though Hemingway had already written much about war and tribulations and had never seemed inclined to limit the use of vulgar language, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a clear exemption. When writing dialogue, Hemingway would insert the word 'obscenity' instead of writing the exact word or phrase. There has been a lot of discussion about the reason for such omissions, and while some believe Hemingway was worried about the book being banned and thus wanted to make the book as reader-friendly as possible for a brutally violent war novel, others believe the omissions of profanity was due to transliteration problems and the author's attempt to be as honest to the dialogue he heard as possible.There is no arguing with the legacy and influence Hemingway had not only on American culture, but also on generations of future writers. Hemingway inspired countless journalists with his in-depth profiles and wartime articles. Even the cities where he wrote his books are now places for pilgrimage among his most devoted fans. Hemingway first started writing For Whom the Bell Tolls in Cuba and later finished it in Sun Valley, Idaho. In fact, both hotel rooms are now popular tourist destinations.</Summary></Book><Book><Id>20</Id><title>Falcon</title><timePeriod>1998</timePeriod><author>Hammer</author><edition>Signed first edition</edition><Summary>A famous detective book</Summary></Book></ArrayOfBook>
